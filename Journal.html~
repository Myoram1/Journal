	Challenges: Our group doesnt seem to encounter interpersonal challenges at all, our team members get along well and we are cogenial people. In other words, we are easy to get along with or come to an agreement with. However, if we were to ecounter a disagreement between certain team members, I believe we will solve it quickly because our group knows that we like to procrastinate, so we should try to work as soon as possible. Our group will have a lot of trouble with scheduling as we tend to procrastinate and get little to no work done in a school day. In order to overcome scheduling challenges, we plan to work as soon as possible and try to minimize our work before the end of the semester. We may have to spend more time on the ISP project early because of the extra courses that are also required to complete before finals which will take us some time. If we do are not efficiently working in class, we can also call outside of school time to work on the project or meet up. The main problem our group will face is technical challenges due to our lack of computer science knowledge and our lack of coding skills. To overcome this challenge, we will try to learn possibly from youtube videos (tutorial videos) or anything we can find on the internet that is trustworthy and reliable.

       <div class="roles">
	 Roles: <br>
	 Development Engineer: This role designs the product or improve the product given to them in attempt to raise revenue and gain more attention. I personally think that creativity is an important quality needed to be successful in this role which could be a valid reason for me to obtain this role for our ISP project. I also love to design in general so this role would suit me perfectly and is my favorite out of the 4 roles required. <br>
	 QA Engineer: A quality assurance engineer in simple terms is someone who checks to make sure the product meets the desired expectations or standards. Although this sounds like a more easy role, I think I might not be the best at this role because I am very uncomfortable with fixing code as it is quite difficult for me. I wouldnt mind this role but would rather let another team member to take this position instead. <br> 
	 Project Manager: A project manager basically manages the whole team by planning and organizing depending on the scedules and restraints. I am really good at planning and organizing a schedule, the only problem I may face is actually sticking to the schedule and commiting to it. This role would suit me well as long as another member can help the team to commiting to the plans created. <br>
	 Product Manager: A product manager identifies the customers and the more important objectives that a product is targeting. I have a hard time adjusting to peoples needs, especially when the product cannot fulfill everyones needs. On the other hand, I am decent at convincing people so I could possibly help persuade more people into buying our product.<br>
