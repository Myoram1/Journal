    <h1 style="text-align:center;font-size:350%">Time Management</h1>

    <hr><center>Our ISP project will be developing an app/website to help students with time management and productivity. Students will be able to input any assignments as well as how long they plan to work on each one. Our app will also provide and explain strategic learning approaches regarding academic procrastination and smartphone addiction, which is one of the main problems that result in less progress. The covid pandemic has obviously affected and created a huge impact on our society, causing many students to become lazy, have less energy, and most importantly, have anxiety. Our time management app will hopefully solve all the problems that occurred due to the pandemic and shift students around the world back into a productive person with a strong mentality.
